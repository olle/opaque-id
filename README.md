A small helper library for building opaque semantic identifiers.

## "CYPHER: Ignorance is bliss."

Sometimes, when information needs to cross over boundaries of ownership,
it may be very convenient to provide the option of non-transparency. We've
had great success with this solution, working with friendly scalar values, 
which can be passed around or stored easily, encapsulating unique and
canonical identifiers across distributed systems and service oriented
solutions.
