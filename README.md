A small helper library for building opaque semantic identifiers.

## "CYPHER: Ignorance is bliss."

Sometimes, when information needs to cross over boundaries of ownership,
it may be very convenient to provide the option of non-transparency. We've
had great success with this solution, providing a friendly scalar value, 
which can be passed around or stored, encapsulating unique and canonical
identifiers for distributed systems and service oriented solutions.
